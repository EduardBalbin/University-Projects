To access data loaded via the radio station API, you would need to first visit the sites indicated in the report and register; alternatively, you can simply upload the 'radio_stations.csv' file.

Regarding the Spotify API, it should work with our credentials; otherwise, registration is required.

Reproduce the Python code.

Open the R file and run it; all files loaded in this code are among the provided data.

Open SQL and load the project and the database; if the database fails to load, importing the previously created tables should be sufficient: match1_1, match1_2, match1_3, match1_4, radio1generi, generi2. Run the queries and ensure they work.

The work was done using: RStudio (R), Jupyter Notebook (Python), DB Browser for SQLite (SQL).
